# **1.** Translate the following hexadecimal numbers to binary. <br>0x0, 0x10, 0xF, 0x1F, 0xA4, 0xFF

# **2.** Find the bitwise and, or and xor of the following:<br>a) 0xC6 with 0x35<br>b) 0x19 with 0x24<br>c) 0xD3 with 0xC7<br>d) 0x17 with 0xFF

# **3.** Find the 1’s complement of the following:<br>0xC6, 0x35, 0xD3 and 0xC7.

# **4.** In this question & is bitwise and, | is bitwise or, ^ is bitwise xor, and ! is 1’s complement. a is any given two digit hexadecimal number. Explain why each of the following identities holds.<br><br> a) 0xFF & a = a. (0xFF is the identity for AND)<br>b) 0xFF | a = 0xFF. (0xFF is the absorbent for OR)<br>c) 0xFF ^ a = !a<br>d) 0 & a = 0. (0 is the absorbent for AND)<br>e) 0 | a = a. (0 is the identity for OR)<br>f) 0 ^ a = a. (0 is the identity for XOR)<br>g) a ^ a = 0 (a is its own inverse under XOR)<br>h) For any three two digit hexadecimal numbers a, b and c: If a ^ b = c then a ^ c = b.

# **5.** Write a program that counts the number of bits set in an integer. For example, the number 5 (decimal), which is 0000000000000101 (binary), has two bits set.

# **6.** Write a program that takes a 32-bit integer (long int) and splits it into eight 4-bit values. (Be careful of the sign bit.)

# **7.** Write a program that will take the bits in a number and shift them to the left end. For example, 01010110 (binary) would become 11110000 (binary).
